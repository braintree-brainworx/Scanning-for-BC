**Warehouse Shipments:** 
On a Warehouse Shipment, click the lines section menu

- If the location requires Picks, the button will not be displayed. This is because tracking is done from the Pick and item tracking cannot be assigned from the warehouse shipment when picks are required.

- If the location does not require Pick, the button will be displayed. The scanning process continues in a similar way to the Warehouse Receipts.

**Warehouse Picks:** On warehouse picks, the standard lines section is hidden on mobile devices and a mobile friendly section is displayed. It currently caters for the source documents Sales Order and Transfer Order. When a tracking no. is captured, the system will check the bin contents and assign the available quantity to pick. If there isn’t enough to cover the outstanding quantity, the split function should be used to scan a tracking no. from another bin.

- _Split function:_ If available, the user can click the split button. This will prompt the user to enter a value for the Qty. to Handle field. Accepting the changes sets the Quantity on the current line to the same as the Qty. to Handle and creates a new line for the difference between the original Quantity and the new Quantity.
- _Set Qty. function:_ If available, this allows the user to capture a new value for the Qty. to Handle field.
